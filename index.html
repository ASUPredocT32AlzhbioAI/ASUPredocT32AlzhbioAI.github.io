        <h4>Project Summary</h4>
        <p class="w3-opacity">
            The development of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and AD Related Dementias (ADRD) is impacted by biological, 
            clinical, socio-demographic, and lifestyle factors. Therefore, training the workforce for AD/ADRD research 
            requires an interdisciplinary approach that is informed by community and clinical need, which is in turn 
            critical to rapid translation of fundamental research into practice and communities. This proposal aims at 
            developing an interdisciplinary training program for nurturing 9-10 predoctoral trainees annually 
            (6 of 10 in years 1-4 and 5 of 9 in year 5 trainees will be supported by NIH, and 4 each year will be 
            supported by Arizona State University (ASU), who will be mentored by a team of faculty from different 
            units/schools at ASU and clinicians/researchers from Mayo Clinic, Banner Alzheimer Institute, Barrow 
            Neurological Institute, and TGen, with diverse expertise covering AD/ADRD clinical science, diagnostics 
            and engineering, disease biology, data science, and drug discovery/development. The training program will 
            leverage AD/ADRD resources in Arizona and actively engage the Arizona Alzheimer’s Consortium (AAC) and the 
            Arizona Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC). The program is in a unique position to partner with 
            Mirabella, a senior living community on the ASU campus, and Hospice of the Valley, Arizona's leading 
            provider of end-of-life care, and other community partners to provide the trainees with real-life 
            experiences. The team has designed a unique program with well-rounded training opportunities covering 
            the following four dimensions: curriculum-based training, research training, career development, and 
            community-based real-world experiences. Recognizing the exponentially increasing amount of data in all 
            disciplines involved in AD/ADRD research and the critical and often enabling role that Artificial 
            Intelligence (AI) plays in data-intensive research, the proposed training program employs a data-centric 
            approach with AI being a bridge serving to connect all the involved disciplines through its role as a data 
            processing and inference engine. Accordingly, the focus of the proposed curriculum-based training and 
            research training is on helping the trainee to gain the fundamental knowledge and research skills in 
            employing AI for AD/ADRD research. The training faculty have established track records, not only for 
            pursing AI and AD/ADRD research, but also for doctoral student mentoring. Further, there are active 
            collaborations among the training faculty, which have helped to shape the design of the initial set of 
            research projects that are ready to be deployed for the choice of the first batch of trainees.

        <h4>Project Narrative</h4>
        <p class="w3-opacity">
            Early detection of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia (AD/ADRD) makes it possible for initiation of 
            early intervention, its assessment (preventive clinical trials) to slow down the progression, even prevent 
            the onset and reduce care costs. Leveraging unique AD/ADRD resources in Arizona including the Arizona 
            Alzheimer’s Consortium (AAC) and Mirabella - a senior living community on the Arizona State University 
            campus, we propose to train pre-doctoral researchers with an Artificial Intelligence (AI) mindset when 
            attacking long-standing challenges in AD/ADRD research including clinical science, diagnostics and 
            engineering, disease biology, data science, and drug discovery/development. This novel integration 
            provides the opportunity not only for intergenerational education but also for community defined field 
            research projects in the training program.
